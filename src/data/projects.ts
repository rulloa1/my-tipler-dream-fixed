    description: "Over a 5-month period, we transformed a 4,200 sq ft condominium into a beachfront sanctuary of modern design. This custom renovation introduces a new standard of coastal living, where breathtaking ocean views are framed by floor-to-ceiling hurricane-rated windows. We infused the space with custom Italian marble stone floors as a foundation for designers who added beautiful stone, hand-applied specialty wall finishes, and crafted bespoke millwork, culminating in a chef's kitchen equipped with professional-grade appliances. The newest Smart-Home Technologies were obtained and installed, with most components not even available to the public yet. Custom scalloped Solid Wood Paneling was made from rare South American wood—the likes of which cannot be obtained in this country anymore. Hand-picked craftsmen, world-class millworkers, and extremely talented specialists installed hand-applied specialty wall finishes, all working in perfect harmony to deliver this one-of-a-kind ocean-side residence. On Budget, On Schedule, and Perfectly On Point.",
